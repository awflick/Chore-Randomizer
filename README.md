This is my first solo python project. 
It's a chore randomizer for families. 
I plan to use the regular 'Chore Randomizer' code as the history tracking version works but causes users to re-enter chores after all have been assigned. 
Trying to keep this one simple for my first project.
May add a fonrt-end webpage / app for this one.
